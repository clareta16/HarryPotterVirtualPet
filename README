# VirtualPet Harry Potter App

This project is a web application for managing virtual pets inspired by the world of **Harry Potter**. Users can register, log in, choose their pet, assign a color, and interact with it through actions such as **Train**, **Sleep**, and **Eat**. When the pet is ready, it can fight the Dark Lord, marked as **Ready to Fight Dark Lord**.
